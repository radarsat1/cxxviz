# Tools for analysis and visualization of C++ code

These are some interim tools designed to translate output from C++
analysers into a format possible to use with visualisation tools such
as [Moose](http://www.moosetechnology.org/).

They remain somewhat unpolished, stay tuned for some
instructions and examples.

## SrcML to MSE converter

Find some entities in SrcML output for C++ (classes, functions,
variable, etc.) and outputs them in MSE format.

Usage:

~~~
./srcml-to-mse.py
